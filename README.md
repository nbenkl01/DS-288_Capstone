# Data Science Capstone Project

Repository for work surrounding Tufts MSDS Capstone project.

## Mission Statement (Project Proposal)

Our mission is to explore the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) in improving transferability of physiological data models from controlled laboratory settings, where precise labels are readily available, to real-world environments, where such labels are scarce. In particular, we employ personalized representation learning to support individualized results. In pursuit of this mission, we study the use of physiological data from non-invasive wearables in detecting acute psychological stress events. Through this work, we aim to better transfer insights from controlled environments to practical scenarios, ultimately fostering greater adaptability, accessibility, and efficacy of personalized physiological modeling.


## Weekly Status Report (Weeks 19)
### Fails
- Nurses baseline classifier shows issues with validation data batch-loading leading to undesireable early stopping and poor model fit.

### Successes
- Resolved data streaming connection issue
- Updated Mission Statement
- Finished masked prediction pretraining
- Finished stress event classification finetuning
- Collected preliminary evaluation results

#### General Progress
- Continued work on model evaluation & analysis

### Goals
- Continue model evaluation, extend suite of tests to better collect & represent results as means of studying thesis question
