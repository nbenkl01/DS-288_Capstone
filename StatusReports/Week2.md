### Fails
- Unsuccessful in locating data source linking biomarkers to health outcomes.

### Successes
- Pulled and reviewed All of Us biomarker data & EHR data separately
- Defined project propoasal "mission statement" 

### General Progress
- Begun looking into wearable sensors for neuroprostheses
- Looked into work using RL over sensors (like Myo Armband) for improving manipulation of prosthetic limbs

### Goals
- Finalize/decide upon project concept.
- Find source for all necessary data
- Sketch out general project design.
- Continue preliminary lit-review.
- (bonus) Sketch out timeline
