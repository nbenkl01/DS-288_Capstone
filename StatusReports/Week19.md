### Fails
- Nurses baseline classifier shows issues with validation data batch-loading leading to undesireable early stopping and poor model fit.

### Successes
- Resolved data streaming connection issue
- Updated Mission Statement
- Finished masked prediction pretraining
- Finished stress event classification finetuning
- Collected preliminary evaluation results

#### General Progress
- Continued work on model evaluation & analysis

### Goals
- Continue model evaluation, extend suite of tests to better collect & represent results as means of studying thesis question
