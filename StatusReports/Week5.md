### Fails
- Out on sick-leave with Concussion (no/low productivity)

### Successes
- Gained access to TILES Account

### General Progress
- Submitted DUA forms to access TILES data
- Begun doing lit-review for biomarker feature engineering
- Considered methods for timeseries study over biomarker signals (Transformers vs. iTransformers, biomarker ablation study)

### Goals
- Access TILES 2018 & TILES 2019
- Design feature engineering pipeline
- Run/update TILES open-source data-cleaning code
- Continue preliminary lit-review.
- Refine capstone task.
