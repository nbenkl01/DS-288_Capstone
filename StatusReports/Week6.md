### Fails
- No DUA Approval yet

### Successes
- Pulled and begun assessing TILES data-processing code base.

### General Progress
- Began sketching out additional data cleaning approaches.
  - Z-score metrics w/in individual.
  - Assess metrics while sleeping as resting baseline.
  - ...
- Started looking into sparse-supervision for timeseries data:
  - Developing idea similar to Kalman Filtering for assessing continuous "stress-scores" against daily survey data.
- Continued combing through codebase and outlining data inputs and targets for modeling approach.

### Goals
- Finally Access TILES 2018 & TILES 2019
- Continue lit-review.
  - Biomarker signals
  - Survey data processing
  - Sparse signal supervised-learning
  - etc.
- Sketch out modeling approach
