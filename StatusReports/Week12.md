### Fails
- Attempted (failed) to mount TILES on AWS E2 virtual compute server.
- Attempted (failed) to transfer tiles to GCP bucket.

### Successes
- Found E4SelfLearning data repository and E4mer code repository
- Replicated data preprocessing & segmentation work from [Corponi et al., 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39018100/)
- Replicated SSL E4mer pretraining over masked prediction as described in same.

### General Progress
- Decided to stop persuing TILES analysis.
- Met w/ Marty & reviewed Design Document.
  - Decided Design Doc proposal was overly ambitios.
- Began isolating more achievable study question for remaining term.

### Goals
- Decide upon new study question subset of proposal.
